# 🎯 Mastering Generics in TypeScript 🚀

## 📌 Introduction
Generics in TypeScript provide a **powerful way** to create **reusable, flexible, and type-safe** code. Instead of locking in specific types, generics allow us to define **dynamic placeholders**, making our code more **scalable and maintainable**. 💡

This folder contains well-structured explanations of **key generics concepts** to help you level up your TypeScript skills. Each topic is linked for easy access! 🔗✨

## 📂 Folder Structure 📁
Explore the key concepts of **Generics** in TypeScript:

### 📌 [1️⃣ Problem Without Generics](https://github.com/Ahad-mirza/Typescript/tree/main/05_generics/01_problem_without_generics)
🔹 Understand **why generics are needed** by exploring common problems without them.

### 📌 [2️⃣ Generic Classes](https://github.com/Ahad-mirza/Typescript/tree/main/05_generics/02_generic-classes)
🔹 Create **reusable generic classes** that work with multiple data types.

### 📌 [3️⃣ Generic Functions](https://github.com/Ahad-mirza/Typescript/tree/main/05_generics/03_generic-functions)
🔹 Enhance **code reusability** with functions that adapt to various data types.

🚧 **Work in Progress:** The following topics are currently being developed and will be updated soon! 🚀

### 📌 [4️⃣ Generic Interfaces](./generic-interfaces/README.md)
🔹 Use **interfaces** dynamically with generics for **better type enforcement**.


### 📌 [5️⃣ Generic Constraints](./generic-constraints/README.md)
🔹 Restrict **generic types** to specific structures for safer coding. 🚦

### 📌 [6️⃣ Extending Generic Classes](./extended-generic-classes/README.md)
🔹 Learn how to **extend** and enhance generic classes while preserving flexibility.

### 📌 [7️⃣ Keyof Operator](./keyof-operator/README.md)
🔹 Use **`keyof`** to dynamically reference object property keys with type safety. 🔑

### 📌 [8️⃣ Type Mapping](./type-mapping/README.md)
🔹 Transform object types dynamically using **type mapping techniques**. 🎭

## 🚀 Why Use Generics?
✅ **Code Reusability** – One implementation, multiple use cases! 🔄
✅ **Type Safety** – Catch errors at compile-time instead of runtime. 🛑
✅ **Improved Readability** – Write cleaner, more **expressive** code. ✍️
✅ **Scalability** – Adapt to new use cases **without rewriting** everything. 🔧
