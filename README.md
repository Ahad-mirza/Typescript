## Introduction to TypeScript 📝

**TypeScript** is a strongly typed superset of **JavaScript** that adds static typing to the language. It allows you to catch errors early during development and provides a more structured approach to writing JavaScript. 🌈

- **Type Safety** 🛡️: Helps avoid runtime errors.
- **Improved IDE Support** 💻: Features like autocompletion, type checking, and navigation.
- **Scalable Code** 📈: Great for large-scale applications with better maintainability.

---

## Core Concepts 💡

TypeScript has some core features that are essential to understanding the language:

- **Variables and Types** 🏷️: Working with different data types and type annotations.
- **Functions** 🧮: Understanding function signatures, return types, and parameter types.
- **Interfaces & Types** 🖋️: Defining custom types and interfaces for better structure.
- **Generics** 🔄: Making your code more reusable and flexible.

## Fundamentals 🏗️

In this section, you will find a deep dive into the fundamentals that form the foundation of TypeScript:

- **Basic Syntax** 📜: How TypeScript syntax differs from JavaScript.
- **Type Inference** 🤔: How TypeScript guesses types automatically.
- **Type Aliases** 🏷️: Creating custom names for complex types.
- **Union & Intersection Types** ➗: Combining multiple types into one.

---

## Advanced Types ⚡

Level up your TypeScript skills with these advanced concepts:

- **Mapped Types** 🛠️: Transforming types dynamically.
- **Conditional Types** ❓: Types based on conditions.
- **Indexed Access Types** 🔍: Accessing types from objects or arrays dynamically.
- **Utility Types** 🧰: Common types for working with objects, arrays, and more.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript 🏰

Learn how to apply **Object-Oriented Programming** principles in TypeScript for more structured and maintainable code:

- **Classes** 🏫: Creating and using classes in TypeScript.
- **Encapsulation** 🔒: Keeping data secure with access modifiers.
- **Inheritance** 🌳: Extending classes and reusing code.
- **Polymorphism** 🔄: Using the same interface for different types.
- **Getters and Setters** 🔧: Accessing and modifying private data.
