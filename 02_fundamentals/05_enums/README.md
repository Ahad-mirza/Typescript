## 1️⃣ What Are Enums?

In **TypeScript**, an **enum** is a special "class" that represents a group of **related constants**. It helps make code more **readable** and **manageable**.

Enums are commonly used to define a set of related values, such as sizes, directions, or states.

---

## 2️⃣ Declaring Enums

### Example:
```typescript
enum Size {
  Small,
  Medium,
  Large
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`enum Size`** 🎯: Declares an enum named `Size` with three members: `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large`.
- By **default**, TypeScript assigns:
  - `Small = 0`
  - `Medium = 1`
  - `Large = 2`

---

## 3️⃣ Numeric Enums 🔢

You can **explicitly set numeric values**:
```typescript
enum Size {
  Small = 1,
  Medium,
  Large
}
```

### Key Points:
- When `Small = 1`, TypeScript automatically assigns:
  - `Medium = 2`
  - `Large = 3`
- This behavior is useful when you need specific numeric mappings.

---

## 4️⃣ String Enums ✍️

Enums can also have **string values**:
```typescript
enum Size {
  Small = "S",
  Medium = "M",
  Large = "L"
}
```

### Important Notes:
- For **string enums**, you **must** explicitly assign a value to each member.
- This provides clarity, especially when working with **readable data formats** like APIs.

---

## 5️⃣ Using Enums 🚀

You can declare a variable and assign an enum value:
```typescript
let mySize: Size = Size.Medium;
console.log(mySize); // Outputs: 2 (if using numeric enums)
```

### How It Works:
- **`mySize`** is assigned the enum member `Size.Medium`.
- When logged to the console, it displays:
  - **`2`** for numeric enums.
  - **`"M"`** for string enums.

---

## 6️⃣ Enum Compilation ⚙️

When TypeScript compiles your code:
1. Use `tsc` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
   ```bash
   tsc index.ts
   ```
2. Run the compiled JavaScript with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### Behind the Scenes:
- The compiler generates JavaScript code where enums are represented as objects.
- Numeric enums allow **reverse mapping** (getting the name from the value), while string enums do not.

---

## 7️⃣ Best Practices ✅

- **Use `const enum`** for optimized performance:
  ```typescript
  const enum Size {
    Small = 1,
    Medium,
    Large
  }
  ```
  This reduces the generated JavaScript code.

- **Prefer String Enums for Readability:**
  - APIs and UI-related code benefit from string enums because they are **more descriptive**.

- **Avoid Mixing Types:**
  - Stick to either numeric or string values within the same enum.

---

## 8️⃣ Conclusion 🌟

- **Enums** are a powerful feature to group related constants.
- They improve **code readability**, **type safety**, and **consistency**.
- Use them wisely, and leverage `const enum` for optimized builds.

**TypeScript Enums = Clean Code + Maintainability + Performance!** 💙🚀
