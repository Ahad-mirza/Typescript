# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript 🖥️💡

Welcome to the **OOP in TypeScript** section of this repository! 🎉 In this folder, we’ll be diving deep into the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which will allow you to create more organized, scalable, and maintainable code. 🌍

OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that models real-world objects and their interactions. By leveraging classes and objects, we can easily structure and manage data while keeping code clean and reusable. 🌟 TypeScript brings an added layer of static typing and object-oriented features to help you write robust and reliable applications. 🛠️

### 🌟 Why Learn OOP?

1. **Modularity:** OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable chunks.
2. **Code Reusability:** Once you create a class, it can be reused across your project without redundant code.
3. **Abstraction:** OOP hides unnecessary details and focuses on the essential features of an object.
4. **Maintainability:** OOP makes it easier to maintain and extend your codebase as your project grows.

## 🔎 What You'll Learn Here

In this folder, we explain the following key OOP concepts in TypeScript:

### 1. **OOP Introduction** 📘
An introduction to the core principles of OOP, including **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**. We’ll set the foundation for all other concepts you’ll learn here.

### 2. **Classes and Objects** 🏷️
- **Classes:** The blueprint for creating objects, where we define properties and methods.
- **Objects:** Instances of classes that hold actual data and interact with other objects.

### 3. **Readonly and Optional Properties** 🔒
Learn how to create properties that are **immutable** (readonly) or **optional** (with defaults) to increase the flexibility and integrity of your classes.

### 4. **Access Control Keywords** 🔑
Understand the importance of access control in OOP with **public**, **private**, and **protected** keywords, which help you define how and where properties and methods can be accessed or modified.

### 5. **Parameter Properties** 🎯
Simplify constructor syntax by using **parameter properties**, making your code more concise and readable.

### 6. **Getters and Setters** 🔄
Learn how to create controlled access to class properties with **getters** and **setters**, allowing you to perform logic when getting or setting values.
